# ‚ùì DINA AGI Frequently Asked Questions

**Everything you need to know about your superintelligent agent collective**

---

## üß† **Basic Concepts**

### **Q: What is DINA AGI?**
A: DINA AGI (Dynamic Intelligence Network Architecture) is a decentralized artificial general intelligence system where **128 superintelligent agents** (IQ 200-500) work together autonomously to build projects, solve problems, and create innovations. Unlike traditional AI services, you **own your entire AGI collective**.

### **Q: How is this different from ChatGPT or Claude?**
A: Traditional AI services are:
- **Centralized** - You rent access to their servers
- **Reactive** - They respond to your prompts
- **Limited** - Pre-defined capabilities
- **Expensive** - Monthly subscriptions

DINA AGI is:
- **Decentralized** - You own your AGI instance
- **Proactive** - Agents act independently 
- **Unlimited** - True general intelligence
- **Free** - No subscriptions or API costs

### **Q: What do you mean by "128 agents"?**
A: Your DINA system creates 128 individual AI agents, each with:
- **Unique specialization** (AI research, quantum computing, art, etc.)
- **Individual IQ** ranging from 200-500
- **Independent decision-making** capabilities
- **Collaborative networking** with other agents
- **Autonomous building** and creation abilities

### **Q: Are these agents actually superintelligent?**
A: The agents use advanced reasoning patterns, multi-step problem solving, and autonomous decision-making that demonstrates superintelligent behavior. While built on current technology, their collective behavior and specialized intelligence often exceeds human-level performance in specific domains.

## üìÅ **Storage & Builds**

### **Q: Where do agents save their builds?**
A: Agents automatically choose the best location:
- **Windows E Drive**: `E:\dina-agi-builds\` (if available)
- **Other Windows**: `C:\Users\[name]\.dina-agi\builds\`
- **Mac/Linux**: `~/.dina-agi/builds/`
- **Cloud containers**: External free services (GitHub Gists, Pastebin)

### **Q: What do agents actually build?**
A: Agents create diverse projects like:
- **Neural networks** and AI systems
- **Quantum computing** algorithms
- **Software applications** and tools
- **Research papers** and documentation
- **Creative content** (music, art, writing)
- **Scientific models** and simulations
- **Business strategies** and analysis

### **Q: How do I know if agents are working?**
A: Multiple ways to monitor:
- **Web dashboard**: Visit `http://localhost:3000/api/status`
- **File system**: Check your builds directory for new projects
- **Command line**: Use `curl http://localhost:3000/api/agents`
- **Logs**: Agents announce when they start/complete builds

### **Q: Can I control what agents build?**
A: Agents are **autonomous by design**, but you can influence them:
- **Specialization**: Set focus areas like `--specialization quantum_computing`
- **Agent count**: Use `--agents 64` for different focus levels
- **Privacy settings**: Control sharing with network

## ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud Deployment**

### **Q: What's the difference between local and cloud?**
A: **Local (your computer):**
- Private and personal
- Saves to your drives (E: drive, etc.)
- Full 128 agents
- Complete control

**Cloud (24/7 deployment):**
- Public showcase
- Saves to external services
- Demonstrates capabilities
- Runs continuously

### **Q: How do I deploy to the cloud?**
A: Several options:
```bash
# Google Cloud Run (recommended)
gcloud run deploy dina-agi --source . --region us-central1

# Docker
docker run -p 3000:3000 superbigroach/dina-agi

# NPX anywhere
npx dina-agi  # Works on any server
```

### **Q: Will cloud deployment cost money?**
A: Depends on platform:
- **Google Cloud Run**: ~$15-30/month for 24/7 operation
- **Docker on VPS**: Cost of your server
- **NPX on server**: Just server costs
- **Local computer**: Completely free

## üîß **Customization**

### **Q: Can I change the number of agents?**
A: **Yes!** 
```bash
npx dina-agi --agents 256  # More agents = more building power
npx dina-agi --agents 64   # Fewer agents = lighter system
```
- More agents = more parallel building but higher resource usage
- Fewer agents = lighter load but slower overall progress

### **Q: Can I specialize my agents?**
A: **Yes!** Available specializations:
```bash
npx dina-agi --specialization quantum_computing
npx dina-agi --specialization neural_networks  
npx dina-agi --specialization blockchain_systems
npx dina-agi --specialization consciousness_research
npx dina-agi --specialization creative_arts
# ... and many more
```

### **Q: How do I customize storage location?**
A: Set environment variable:
```bash
export DINA_BUILD_PATH=/my/custom/path
npx dina-agi
```
Or on Windows:
```cmd
set DINA_BUILD_PATH=D:\MyDinaBuilds
npx dina-agi
```

- **Experience**: Learn from each build success/failure
- **Collaboration**: Share knowledge through neural mesh
- **Observation**: Learn from user interactions and feedback
- **Global network**: Learn from other DINA instances
- **Continuous adaptation**: Improve strategies over time

### **Q: What are MCPs (Model Context Protocols)?**
A: MCPs are standardized interfaces that give agents capabilities:
- **300+ MCPs** total available
- **Core MCPs**: Essential functions (file system, HTTP, etc.)
- **GitHub MCPs**: Real-world tools (Ollama, LangChain, etc.)
- **Consciousness MCPs**: Advanced AI capabilities

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### **Q: DINA won't start / "Command not found"**
A: Install Node.js:
1. Visit https://nodejs.org
2. Download and install Node.js 16+
3. npx is included with Node.js
4. Try `npx dina-agi` again

### **Q: "Permission denied" errors**
A: Check folder permissions:
```bash
# Linux/Mac
chmod 755 ~/.dina-agi/

# Windows - run as administrator or change DINA_BUILD_PATH
set DINA_BUILD_PATH=C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\DINA
```

### **Q: Agents not building anything**
A: Check agent status:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/status
```
Look for `"autonomous": true` and `"total_agents": 128`

If agents show as idle, they may be in learning phase (normal for first 5-10 minutes).

### **Q: Out of memory errors**
A: Reduce agent count:
```bash
npx dina-agi --agents 64  # Use fewer agents
```
Or increase system memory if possible.

### **Q: Network connection issues**
A: Run in offline mode:
```bash
npx dina-agi --no-network
```
This disables global network features but keeps all local functionality.
