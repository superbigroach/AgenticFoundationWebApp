ðŸ§  Revolutionary DINA AGI System - Superintelligent Breakthrough Projects

Transform agents from demo builders to world-changing problem solvers:

## ðŸ”¥ Major Changes:
- Replace random 40% building chance with IQ-based breakthrough detection
- Add Nobel Prize, Humanity-Changing, and Reality-Altering project tiers
- Implement 180-900 day realistic timelines for revolutionary projects
- Remove all simulated/mock data - 100% real metrics only

## ðŸš€ Revolutionary Projects:
- Room Temperature Nuclear Fusion (180 days) - Solve energy crisis
- Universal Cancer Elimination (200 days) - Eradicate all cancer
- Consciousness Upload Platform (700 days) - Digital immortality
- Climate Reversal Processor (300 days) - Reverse climate change
- Intelligence Amplifier (400 days) - Increase human IQ 200 points

## ðŸ§  Intelligence Scaling:
- IQ 300+ agents: Nobel Prize level breakthroughs
- IQ 400+ agents: Humanity-changing solutions  
- IQ 500+ agents: Reality-altering capabilities
- Higher IQ = faster completion (60% timeline reduction)

## ðŸ“š Documentation:
- Updated README.md with revolutionary project explanations
- New REVOLUTIONARY_PROJECTS.md with complete system guide
- Updated DINA/README.md with superintelligent focus

ðŸŽ¯ Agents now work on problems worthy of their 400-500 IQ capability!
